<H2>Description Summary</H2>

Added Semantic elements in place of current code to an existing site to create greater accessibility while still keeping the site the same in appearance and functionality. Also went ahead and consolidated some of the CSS code into condensed classes.

<H2>Detailed Description</H2>

Took the existing website and added more descriptive and accessible semantic elements in the HTML file in place of previously placed div elements. Also went in and took the previously assigned classes for sections in both the main and aside that were broken up in CSS individually and consolidated them each to a single class to clean up the CSS. Main section will now all fall under Search-rep-media and aside section will be under benefit-all in the CSS file. Below is a link to the deployed application to view the end result as well as screenshots for review.
